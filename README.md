# Rotarod_Analysis

With this Analysis, we want to demonstrate an __individualized approach__ of analysing __locomotion__ using the __Rotarod__ test.
We offer different methods of normalizing the `raw` score, which neglects differences between individuals. 
Instead we offer the possibility to look at `absolute` changes in score and at `relative` changes in percent compared to a animal-specific baseline.
The output format is compatible to a statistic tool, developed in our lab: https://github.com/Defense-Circuits-Lab/stats_n_plots.git. 

Please see the Walkthrough.ipynb file for further explanations and the required data structure!
